- error handling: if user input is blank, delete user input. (add complaint/feeling word, add div to div grid)
- error handling: during API call, if user input is not a feeling or complaint word, cancel operation
- review pull request: require selection of one term (?)
- Fix height of AI empathy dialogue. Display scroll bars by default.
